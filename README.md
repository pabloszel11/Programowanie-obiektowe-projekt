# Programowanie-obiektowe-projekt

Project for my Object Oriented Programming course at University of Wroclaw. It is a C++ program for basketball sideline referees to keep players' statistics. 

TODO
Implement some graphic library. Although the program works correctly, its use isn't intuitive and it's hard to keep up with tempo of the game.
